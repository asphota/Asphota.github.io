            <h1 id="review-of-climate-change-impacts-on-the-hydropower-sector">Review of Climate Change Impacts on the Hydropower Sector</h1>
<p>The United Nations has been organizing global climate summits for over 3 decades now. Almost every country on earth participate in these summits – called COPs – which stands for ‘Conference of the Parties’ to work towards a solution to climate change.
In the most recent summit, COP26, the participating countries aggreed on four main goals. The first goal was to biggest goal was &ldquo;Secure global net zero by mid-century and keep 1.5 degrees within reach&rdquo;. This implies that the greenhouse gases emitted in the
atmosphere should be decreased drastically. Today, burning fossil fuel for electricity, heat, and transportation remains the biggest source for greenhouse gases emission. As the world is ever-developing, and the energy demand is ever-increasing, the need of
clean energy source is more crucial than ever before. With a detailed study of the energy produciton and consumption trends, IRENA (2021) predicts that in order to achieve net zero, the current contirbution of renewables has to increase from 25%(2017) to 86%(2050).
As such, many new hydropower projects (additional 850GW by 2050) are being planned in the world to help mitigate climate change (IEA, 2021). The hydropower projects themselves also suffer from climate change impacts. The changes in the hydrologic cycle affects the quantity,
seasonaity, and intensity of flow in river, making the hydropower generation vulnerable to climate change.</p>
<p>In this project, we reviewed over a hundred case-studies of the impact of climate change on individual hydropower projects all around the world. The global review has seperate sections for Asia, Africa, North America, Latin America, Europe, and Australia. Each section is further divided into regions of similar hydro-climate or hydro-politics (making a total of 17 regions) where the major climate change imapcts are complied. Our review concluded that the impact of climate change on hydropower is not uniform all around the globe.
Four primary mechanisms of climate change affecting the global hydropower were identified as: permanent glacier depletion, loss in seasonal snow storage, increased variability, and increased evaporation. These mechanisms have the potential to produce a positive, a negative, or no change to the hydropower generation depending on the seasonality of temperature and precipitation, timing of peak electricity demand, type and design of the hydropower project (with or without storage), and the project location (upstream development).</p>
<p>In this review paper, we also presented the current approahces to quantifying the risks and room for improvement. Climate risks assessment of the individual projects is essential to design new resilient hydropower projects and indentify adaptation measures to the exisitng ones.
These assessments involve developement of series of models with the uncertainties cascading through them. Often times, these uncertainties are not well quantified or communciated in the assesment result which might lead to miscommunication of the vulnerability of the projects.
Moreover, the current approaches are well developed to asess the risks associated with the long-term performance of the hydropower, specific imapcts due to changes in floods, and sediment concentration are still difficult to quantity. Competition with market with other renewable
sources of energy, and compeition for water with other demands are likely to increase under climate change. Moreover from socio-economic perspective, issues such as landlessness, joblessness, marginalization, and food insecurity that are typically associated with poorly planned
dam and infrastructure are possibly aggravated under climate change. The quantification for the later two are barely done in climate risk assessment.</p>
<p>The review paper was published in January 2022 in the journal WIREs Climate Change and can be found <a href="https://wires.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/wcc.757"> here </a>.</p>

<p>Caption: The effect of climate change on global hydropower generation, based on observed trends and near-future projections. The effects are indicated by two levels of symbols: high and low.
Generally, if a climate change effect is discussed in more than 50% of the review papers for the region, a “high” symbol (filled in) is adopted.
Also shown are the major rivers (blue lines), mountain ranges (cyan hue), and the location of existing and planned hydropower plants (purple dots) (Global Energy Observatory, 2018; Zarfl et al., 2015)</p>
