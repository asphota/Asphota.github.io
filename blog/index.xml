      <description>Review of Climate Change Impacts on the Hydropower Sector The United Nations has been organizing global climate summits for over 3 decades now. Almost every country on earth participates in these summits – called COPs – which stands for ‘Conference of the Parties to work towards a solution to climate change. In the most recent summit, COP26, the participating countries agreed on four main goals. The first goal was to biggest goal was &amp;ldquo;Secure global net-zero by mid-century and keep 1.</description>

      <description>California Hydrologic Vulnerability Assessment and Adaptive Planning Project I collaborated in this project, to quantify and visualize the hydrologic vulnerability of the reservoirs in California to changing climatic conditions.
This study  was presented in AGU Fall 2020 meeting. The abstract of the presentation is quoted here:
&amp;ldquo;Understanding the effect of climate variability in terms of reservoir management can be challenging as they rely on stringent operation policies based on the stationary assumption from the likelihood of historical stream-flow extremes.</description>

      <description>Climate Change Risk Assessment of the Upper Arun Hydropower Project in Nepal The International Hydropower Association (IHA, 2019) published Hydropower Sector Climate Resilience Guide  that offers a methodology for identifying, assessing, and managing climate risks to enhance the resilience of hydropower projects. In this project, we used the guide to assess the climate risks (changes in mean, extremes, and effect on daily operation) to a proposed Upper Arun Hydroelectric Project in Nepal for the World Bank.</description>

      <description>Climate Change Risk Analysis of a Hydropower Project in Nepal Hydropower projects face climate change risks due to changes in hydrology with increasing global temperature. To assess the impact on individual hydropower projects, a robustness-based bottom-up approach was introduced known as the Decision Tree Framework in 2015. In collaboration with Deltares and FutureWater, we at the University of Cincinnati analyzed the risks to a hydropower project in Nepal for the World Bank in 2019.</description>

      <description>Improving Operational Flood Forecast The National Weather Service provides real-time flood forecasts in the United States. Thirteen River Forecast Centers (RFCs) are responsible for providing the 5-day streamflow forecasts for rivers throughout the country. The operational hydrologists at the RFCs, apply their expert judgment to adjust and modify the short-range streamflow forecasts as new information becomes available in real-time.

      <description>Application of Hydroinformatics: Topographic Sensitivity in Storm Surge Modeling The National Water Center organizes Summer Institute  every year which is a partnership between CUAHSI and the National Weather Service to engage the academic community in research to advance the mission of the National Water Center.
I participated in the Summer Institute in 2021 and worked with the Hydroinformatics cohort. It was intense but one of the most interesting projects I have done so far.</description>

      <description>Vulnerability Assessment of Drinking Water Supply under Climate Uncertainty using a RANK Model The contamination in the river can enter the water supply system and pollute the drinking water. In this study, a framework was developed to demonstrate the application of a Computational Fluid Dynamics model in risk assessment of contamination exposure in surface waters. This model aims to address the limitations of current water quality models by establishing a two-dimensional finite volume-based model.</description>
