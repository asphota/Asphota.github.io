      <description>Improving Operational Flood Forecast The operational hydrologists of the United States’ National Weather Service (NWS) develop river forecasts as guidance for those at risk of flood damage and update those flood forecasts in real-time as more information becomes available.
In this project, we developed a process to identify the relative importance of uncertain factors in Ohio River Forecast Center (OHRFC) flood forecasts, and empowering National Weather Service (NWS) forecasters to quickly reduce forecast errors through intelligent adjustment of model input data and state variables.</description>

      <description>Review of climate change impacts on the hydropower sector The United Nations has been organizing global climate summits for over 3 decades now. Almost every country on earth participate in these summits – called COPs – which stands for ‘Conference of the Parties’ to work towards a solution to climate change. In the most recent summit, COP26, the participating countries aggreed on four main goals. The first goal was to biggest goal was &amp;ldquo;Secure global net zero by mid-century and keep 1.</description>
