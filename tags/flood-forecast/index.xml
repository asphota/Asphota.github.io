      <description>Improving Operational Flood Forecast The National Weather Service provides real-time flood forecasts in the United States. Thirteen River Forecast Centers (RFCs) are responsible for providing the 5-day streamflow forecasts for rivers throughout the country. The operational hydrologists at the RFCs, apply their expert judgment to adjust and modify the short-range streamflow forecasts as new information becomes available in real-time.
